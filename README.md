# BeansCompany
A mod for Lethal Company to add Beans the Cat

Beans is my friend's cat, and I learned how to use Blender.  I modeled a bean using Beans as a texture.  She appears as scrap and spawns within the facilities.  Find her to sell her or keep her because she is cute.

I do not know what else I should readme about.

Be sure to include LethalLib, but if I wrote the JSON correctly, that should be taken care of.
